# ðŸŽ¤ OpenKJ Request Server

A self-hosted Node.js request server for use with OpenKJ.

## What does OpenKJ Request Server do?
OpenKJ Request Server provides a modern web-based interface for karaoke hosts 
using the OpenKJ karaoke hosting software. Singers can browse and search your 
songbook, submit song requests, and save their favorite songs for later.

OpenKJ Request Server is based the on original PHP 
[StandaloneRequestServer](https://github.com/OpenKJ/StandaloneRequestServer) 
developed by @ILightburn -- rest in peace and thank you for all your hard work!

Because I enjoy karaoke and wanted to give something back, both to the community 
at large and specifically to all those who have contributed their effort to 
creating really great tools for hosts and singers alike.
